# iPhone-style Streamlit Calculator

This is a lightweight Streamlit app that mimics the look and basic behavior of the iPhone calculator (light theme).

## Run locally

1. Create a Python environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # on macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate    # on Windows (PowerShell)
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the local URL Streamlit shows in your browser. The layout is responsive and should look similar to a phone calculator on narrow windows or mobile devices.
